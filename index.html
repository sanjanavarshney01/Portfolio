        <h3>Tea Lover</h3>
        <p>But my best skill is actually in drinking tea. A cup of tea can turn two strangers into friends, as every sip counts for a memory. Tea is such a versatile drink and has a ton of variations and it's smell is so soothing that I had always wanted to spend my loneliness under its company. </p>
